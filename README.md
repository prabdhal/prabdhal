### [NASA Space Challenge Project](https://github.com/prabdhal/NASASpaceProject)

I’m proud to have participated in the NASA International Space Apps Challenge, where my team won 1st place locally.

The game features three mini-games designed to help astronauts stay mentally and physically engaged during long-term space missions:

- **Memory Challenge**: A fun twist on memory skills to combat cognitive challenges in space.
- **Asteroid Dodging**: A reflex-based game that offers physical engagement to counteract inactivity.
- **Relaxing Space Roaming**: A calm exploration mode that provides moments of connection during space travel.
